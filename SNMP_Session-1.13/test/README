A collection of test scripts for the Perl SNMP code.

arp	Sample application that lists the ipNetToMediaTable of a
	host.  Similar to the simple form of the Unix "arp" command.

asn1-test.pl
ber-test.pl
	A few regression tests for BER encoding.  If you get errors
	running these, I'd be very interested to hear about it!

cisco-cpus
	Use CISCO-PROCESS-MIB to get CPU utilization statistics from
	all processors in a Cisco router.  This is most useful for
	routers with multiple CPUs, such as 7500 (RSP) routers with
	VIP2s, or Cisco 12000 (GSR) routers.

cisco-memory
	Print global usage statistics (total/used/free bytes) for
	different types of memory on the main processor of a Cisco
	router.

if-counters.pl (requires Curses.pm)
	Displays a router's byte and packet counter development in
	real-time.  Demonstrates map_table_4 and a heuristic for
	maxRepetitions.

iftop (requires Curses.pm)
	Display top interface counters in real time.
	Based on if-counters.pl.

set-test.pl
	Application that tries to change the sysContact.0 variable and
	then changes it back to the original value.  Contributed by
	Matthew Trunnell <matter@dune.media.mit.edu>

SNMPAgent.pm
	Simple SNMP agent returning nonsense replies.
	Intended as an example of how to write agents.
	Contributed by Mike McCauley <mikem@open.com.au>

sun-find-process
	Use SEA's "sun" MIB to find process ID(s) of processes with a
	specific command name.

sun-ps	List the process table of a remote system using the "sun" MIB
	implemented in Sun's Solstice Enterprise Agents.

test.pl	Trivial application that reads some fixed variables from an
	agent.

trap-send
	Send an SNMPv1 trap to a remote management station

trap-listener
	Sit there and listen for SNMPv1 traps, which are decoded and
	written out in a readable form

walk-intf.pl
	A variant of walk-test.pl that walks several columns of the
	RFC 1213 interfaces table.

walk-test.pl
	Another trivial application that walks two columns in the
	interface table of RFC 1213.

wwwtest	Example for a CGI script that allows SNMP read access to a
	specific set of devices over the Web.
